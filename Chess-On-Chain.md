### Overview

ChessonChain is a substrate-based blockchain platform for chess gaming, providing a decentralized and trustless environment for chess enthusiasts to play, learn, and earn rewards. The platform is designed to leverage the unique advantages of blockchain technology to enhance the gaming experience and create new opportunities for players.

At its core, ChessonChain provides a platform for players to participate in online chess games, tournaments, and events. The platform records and stores every move and game played on the network, providing an immutable and transparent record of game results. This creates a reliable source of game data for analysis and improvement.

One of the unique features of ChessonChain is its Play 2 Earn model, which incentivizes players to participate in the platform and strive for excellence. By earning rewards in the form of in-game tokens and NFTs, players are motivated to continue playing and improving their skills. This creates a vibrant and growing community of chess enthusiasts, who are passionate about the game and its possibilities.

ChessonChain also features a multichain architecture, which enables it to interact with other blockchain networks, users can authenticate with their desired blockchain , play earn , NFTs that are some how equated to the substrate token og the chess chain . This creates new opportunities for players to earn rewards and participate in a vibrant and growing economy around the game.

Overall, ChessonChain provides a secure, scalable, and decentralized platform for chess enthusiasts to participate in online chess games and tournaments, learn from their experiences, and earn rewards for their efforts. By leveraging the unique advantages of blockchain technology, ChessonChain is expanding the possibilities for chess as a game and as a community.


### Project Details
1: Platform Architecture: ChessonChain is built on the Substrate framework, which is a modular blockchain development platform that enables the creation of customizable and scalable blockchain networks. 
This provides ChessonChain with a high degree of flexibility in terms of its features, functionality, and governance and forks

2:Token Economics: ChessonChain uses a native token , which is used as the in-game currency for players to participate in online chess games, tournaments, and events. The CHESS token is also used to reward players for their participation, and can be earned through the Play 2 Earn model. 
The total supply of CHESS tokens will be Available for the public soon.

3:Play 2 Earn Model: The Play 2 Earn model is one of the core features of ChessonChain, which incentivizes players to participate in the platform and strive for excellence. By earning rewards in the form of in-game tokens and NFTs, players are motivated to continue playing and improving their skills. 
This creates a vibrant and growing community of chess enthusiasts, who are passionate about the game and its possibilities.

4:Multichain Architecture: ChessonChain features a multichain architecture, which enables it to interact with other blockchain networks, For now   Ethereum,Stacks , Solana  and Near protocol. 
This creates new opportunities for players to earn rewards and participate in a vibrant and growing economy around the game, and engages web3 individuals .

5:Governance Model: ChessonChain uses a decentralized governance model, which enables the community to have a say in the development and direction of the platform. 
This creates a more democratic and inclusive environment for players to participate in the governance of the platform.

6: Screenshot / Snapshot : Screenshot of checkmate wins are made nfts on the players chain/wallet and this equivalent to in game chess token ,Ofcourse with Winning streak and performance 

7:Team: The ChessonChain team consists of Growing/Learning blockchain developers and chess enthusiasts, who are passionate about the possibilities of combining blockchain technology with the game of chess. 
The team is committed to creating a reliable, secure, and scalable platform for online chess gaming.

8:Data Store: ChessOnchain serves as a data store / leaderboard for Game data , transaction Hashes ,Tokens, User profile and info etc 

9:Game Types : ChessOnchain will have several Chess game types that every chess player will enjoy like  Ecosystem wars and competitions (stacks vs Near , solana vs Etherium etc), Bughouse ,  1v 1, timed , Handicapped , Target Challenge etc
