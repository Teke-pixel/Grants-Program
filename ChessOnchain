## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview

ChessonChain is a substrate-based blockchain platform for chess gaming, providing a decentralized and trustless environment for chess enthusiasts to play, learn, and earn rewards. The platform is designed to leverage the unique advantages of blockchain technology to enhance the gaming experience and create new opportunities for players.

At its core, ChessonChain provides a platform for players to participate in online chess games, tournaments, and events. The platform records and stores every move and game played on the network, providing an immutable and transparent record of game results. This creates a reliable source of game data for analysis and improvement.

One of the unique features of ChessonChain is its Play 2 Earn model, which incentivizes players to participate in the platform and strive for excellence. By earning rewards in the form of in-game tokens and NFTs, players are motivated to continue playing and improving their skills. This creates a vibrant and growing community of chess enthusiasts, who are passionate about the game and its possibilities.

ChessonChain also features a multichain architecture, which enables it to interact with other blockchain networks, users can authenticate with their desired blockchain , play earn , NFTs that are some how equated to the substrate token og the chess chain . This creates new opportunities for players to earn rewards and participate in a vibrant and growing economy around the game.

Overall, ChessonChain provides a secure, scalable, and decentralized platform for chess enthusiasts to participate in online chess games and tournaments, learn from their experiences, and earn rewards for their efforts. By leveraging the unique advantages of blockchain technology, ChessonChain is expanding the possibilities for chess as a game and as a community.






### Project Details
1: Platform Architecture: ChessonChain is built on the Substrate framework, which is a modular blockchain development platform that enables the creation of customizable and scalable blockchain networks. 
This provides ChessonChain with a high degree of flexibility in terms of its features, functionality, and governance.

2:Token Economics: ChessonChain uses a native token called CHESS, which is used as the in-game currency for players to participate in online chess games, tournaments, and events. The CHESS token is also used to reward players for their participation, and can be earned through the Play 2 Earn model. 
The total supply of CHESS tokens is capped at 1 billion.

3:Play 2 Earn Model: The Play 2 Earn model is one of the core features of ChessonChain, which incentivizes players to participate in the platform and strive for excellence. By earning rewards in the form of in-game tokens and NFTs, players are motivated to continue playing and improving their skills. 
This creates a vibrant and growing community of chess enthusiasts, who are passionate about the game and its possibilities.

4:Multichain Architecture: ChessonChain features a multichain architecture, which enables it to interact with other blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polkadot. 
This creates new opportunities for players to earn rewards and participate in a vibrant and growing economy around the game.

5:Governance Model: ChessonChain uses a decentralized governance model, which enables the community to have a say in the development and direction of the platform. 
This creates a more democratic and inclusive environment for players to participate in the governance of the platform.

7:Team: The ChessonChain team consists of Growing/Learning blockchain developers and chess enthusiasts, who are passionate about the possibilities of combining blockchain technology with the game of chess. 
The team is committed to creating a reliable, secure, and scalable platform for online chess gaming.

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/docs/RFPs) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (6 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 30,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

### Milestone 1 — Basic functionality
